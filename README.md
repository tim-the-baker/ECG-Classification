# Classifying ECG signals
Code forked from tinyml_contest2022_demo_example which provided a minimum working example and the data.

The TinyML contest was part of the ICCAD 2022 conference: [Website](https://tinymlcontest.github.io/TinyML-Design-Contest/)

I wasn't able to participate in the contest, but wanted to learn about ECG classification. This repository will track my progress.
